# SudokuSolver

SudokuSolver is an app built for android and ios which solves sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

## Specs
This was the first project I have ever done using the Dart language with Flutter to create an android application. I had heard good things about flutter in the past as an alternative to Android Studio which I had used for my food app. Below demonstrates how it works, however keep in mind that there are only a few loaded test boards, so occasionally requesting a new test board will result in getting the same one back and no change happening. This is intentional.
